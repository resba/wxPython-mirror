README for wxPython-src-2.6.*.tar.bz2
=====================================


This archive contains the source code and other files for both
wxWidgets and wxPython.  Some things not needed for the build (such as
the wxWidgets samples and docs) have been removed in order to minimize
the size of the archive and are available elsewhere.  If you would
like to have the complete set of sources and etc. then please either
use a CVS snapshot from http://wxwindows.org/snapshots/ or do a
checkout from CVS yourself (see http://www.wxwindows.org/cvs.htm.)  If
you would like to use CVS to get the exact same sources as one of
these tarballs then you can update using a release tag.  For example::

      cvs update -r wxPy_2_6_1_0


For more details about building and installing wxWidgets and wxPython
please see these files::

      wxPython/docs/BUILD.txt
      wxPython/docs/INSTALL.txt


For a log of recent changes check these files::

      docs/changes.txt             (for wxWidgets)
      wxPython/docs/CHANGES.txt    (for wxPython)


And for information about major changes in wxPython 2.6 and how to
migrate your existing code to 2.6 please read this file::
